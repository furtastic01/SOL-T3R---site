        <h1>About SOL!T3R</h1>

        <p>
            Welcome to my about page! My name is SOL!T3R. I make chill lofi dreamcore/vaporwave type music. If you are into ambient, lofi, or even retro electronic style music like phonk, I think you may like my music!

            My name is SOL!T3R. People have always described me as "smart", but I just don't feel the same way. If I'm completely honest with myself right now, I'm not a talented artist. There are a million other indie artists who put more effort, time, and craft into their work. I make music as an excuse to find a way to spend my free time, because I feel like playing video games is pretty lazy. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy music production, but to be honest, I love creating music for the styling and album art creation more. By now, you have probably started to realize a lot of my cover art has a certain, retro, 90s, demoscene type art style. That is because most of my album arts are made with an image I find or take, then edit, then put through an ASCII image art generator, then edited again, then cropped. I always go for the old-school VHS aesthetic, considering my music style. To be honest, I just like being a creative person. I love painting—not actual painting, though, mostly just spray painting on canvas, urban art stuff like that. And then photography is something I also enjoy. And then you can't forget coding. To be honest, I didn't have to create this site, but I just love creating websites; it's a good way to take up my time. What I'm trying to say is, I consider myself an artist. And my philosophy is that if you put in enough time, anyone can do what I do. You don't have to have a certain "mind" to create art, whether it's music or painting; you just need to have a certain "mind-set". Anyone can learn to do something, the only thing stopping you from learning is yourself.

            If you enjoy my music, consider looking at other artists with the same style as me! It's probably better for you to support someone who actually lives off of their music revenue than someone like me who just does it for fun. Either way, I hope you have a great time looking through this site! There aren't any easter eggs or anything, but I'm pretty proud of it. Have a great day! Bye!
