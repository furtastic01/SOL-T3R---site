        WayzOfWind.flac is one of the first releases I made despite the fact of other releases coming out before it. That is because when I first tried to distribute it I didnt realise I set a release date instead of making it an instant release.

        I created this single (two songs) because I started experimenting with loops in bandlab. some of my new and future music will be produced in acid pro 11. this and other music of the time was made using royalty free loops in bandlab. although they are loops the actual loops are just instrument loops and I still made and arranged all the actual music & composition. The cover art for this single was made by taking some trippy images I found on google, editing them, blending them, and then putting them through a free image to ascii art text generator, then editing that and changing the aspect ratio to 1:1 for an album art. If you enjoyed this single and havent listened to my other compositions I highly reccomend you do. this style of chill lofi dreamcore is present in many of my other music.

            besides that there is not much to say about this single. I just hoped you enjoyed it, because, to be completely honest, the two songs in this release took me a combined effort of thirty minutes to make. the cover art actually took longer, but whatever.
